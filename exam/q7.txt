LBYL, which stands for 'Look Before You Leap', is a convention that helps
avoid errors. Its principle is to check that something can be done before 
it is actually carried out. For example, in a language like Python, 
an exam of LBYL would be:
if "key" in dict:
    value = dict["key"]

where whether the key exists in the dictionary is checked before anything 
is carried out with the dictionary value of that particular key. In this
example, this prevents the KeyError exception from occurring.
