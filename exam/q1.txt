Continuous Integration is when developers merge changes to code back 
to the main branch often. This code is validated using tests, this 
makes sure the integration process can be monitored and fixed before
the release day. Continuous Delivery, on the other hand, is an extension
of Continuous Integration as it is the practice of automatically deploying
code changes, it is an automated release of code. Instead of being deployed
all at once like in Continuous Integration, it is done when required in
smaller batches. An example of Continuous Integration would be committing 
the code for an application being built in a single repository for a team
project. An example of Continuous Delivery would be updating software for an application
automatically on a mobile phone.
