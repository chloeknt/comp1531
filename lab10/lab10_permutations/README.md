## Lab10 - Exercise - Permutations

In `permutations.py`, complete the definition of the function according to its documentation. Consider what property, or properties, would form a complete definition of this function and write them as property-based tests in `permutations_test.py`. You cannot use `itertools.permutation` to complete this exercise. You must implement the function and tests without it.
