1. Unambigious- requirements need to be easily understood and clearly interpretable in one way. This avoids confusion, saves time and 
prevents unintended outcomes from occuring.

2. Testable- requirements need to be able to be tested in order to determine if the requirement is being implemented correctly. This 
makes sure that the requirements can be verified as working or not working, which provides feedback for future use. 

3. Necessary- requirements need to be compulsory, either the stakeholders need it, or it will affect the system in some way. This saves
time and prevents further problems from occuring due to clashes in intention.
