def roman(numerals):
    '''
    Given Roman numerals as a string, return their value as an integer. You may
    assume the Roman numerals are in the "standard" form, i.e. any digits
    involving 4 and 9 will always appear in the subtractive form.

    For example:
    >>> roman("II")
    2
    >>> roman("IV")
    4
    >>> roman("IX")
    9
    >>> roman("XIX")
    19
    >>> roman("XX")
    20
    >>> roman("MDCCLXXVI")
    1776
