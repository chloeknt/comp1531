## Lab05 - Exercise - Team (1 point)

By yourself, answer the following questions:

1. What do you expect will end up being the biggest challenges of working in a team by the end of the term?
As the project becomes more intertwined with more components, it will be more difficult to divide tasks. Finding time to collaborate and achieve deadlines will also be more difficult as the workload increases. There will also be a lot of decisions that will have to be made so that there is cohesion between our code.

2. Now that we're half way through, what is one aspect of teamwork that you're hoping to learn more about?
How to ensure everybody gets a say and everyone's opinions and input is considered and respected.
